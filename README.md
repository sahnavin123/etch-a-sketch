# etch-a-sketch

The project aims to develop a web-based interactive tool that allows users to draw and manipulate shapes using various tools and controls. The tool will be designed to provide a user-friendly interface that enables users to create their unique designs using the Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation techniques. The final product will resemble an Etch-A-Sketch, providing users with a fun and interactive way to express their creativity.
